<h1>ShapeLand: The Video Game</h1>

The game will start immediately upon upon, simply click 'Ok' on the opening prompt to get to it.

Adding the rides(shapes) will increase guest turnout. Adding the activities (anything that isn't a shape) will give you income for each guest who attends it.

At the moment it's more of a prototype than a full game. There's no real end goal. Just design your park and have fun!
